# TerralithBiomesSelector
## Why does it exist
Terralith is a amazing datapack, but it lacks any configs. So i decided to write this simple application to bring config (some kind of) to this masterpiece.
## How to
1. Download the datapack from the official Stardust Labs website

2. Unzip it (my app can only work with folders, not archives)

3. Run the app and select the folder you got from the previous step

## Important notes
That's what Stardust Labs license says:
>	- You are FORBIDDEN to reupload, republish, or redistribute any Stardust Labs datapack or mod in a standalone format.
>
>	- You are FORBIDDEN to reupload, republish, or redistribute any modified version of any Stardust Labs datapack or mod on its own.
>
>	- You are FORBIDDEN to use any Stardust Labs datapack in any publicly distributed "datapack-pack" without Starmute's express permission. A "datapack-pack" is a collection of datapacks offered for download in a bundled form, which is distinct from a modpack because it can be used on an unmodified client.
>
>	- You are FORBIDDEN to use any modified version of any Stardust Labs datapack as part of any publicly distributed modpack or "datapack-pack" without permission. This includes cases where the datapack is required to be downloaded separately, with parts being overridden.
>
>	- You are FORBIDDEN to use portions of any Stardust Labs datapack or mod's code as part of any other datapack, "datapack-pack", modpack or mod without express permission. You are free to read the code and use it as a resource to learn from, but copying parts of it into another project is not allowed.

So datapacks that you created using my program are for PERSONAL USE ONLY, and you CAN NOT upload it somewhere or distribute it. What you can do:

> - You are UNCONDITIONALLY PERMITTED to use any Stardust Labs datapacks and/or mods for whatever personal purpose you desire. You can use it on a singleplayer world and modify it as much as you want, as long as you don't distribute modified versions of the datapacks and/or mods.
>
> - You are PERMITTED to use Stardust Labs datapacks or mods on any Minecraft server, public or private. It is recommended, but not required, that you give credit to Starmute or note somewhere on your server that said datapack or mod is in use. Furthermore:
>
>	* You are additionally permitted to use Stardust Labs datapacks and mods in any MODIFIED form on any Minecraft server, public or private, provided that you do not distribute any modified versions of said datapacks or mods.
